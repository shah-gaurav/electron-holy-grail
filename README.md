# Holy Grail layout in Electron using CSS Grids
A sample project that shows how to create a holy grail layout in Electron using CSS Grid Layout

## Holy Grail Layouts
When I first started working with Electron, the biggest challange I had was creating a desktop style [Holly Grail Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_%28web_design%29) where the toolbar and the status bar stayed fixed to the top and bottom of the window, but the three columns individually scrolled if the content in them exceeded the available space. Once I discovered and learned [CSS Grids](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) it became a lot easier and cleaner to create this layout. I wanted to share this code in case there are others that need the same kind of layout as a starting point for writing desktop applications using electron.
